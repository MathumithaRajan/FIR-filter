# **FIR FILTER**

## Objective:
This project aims to design a low-pass FIR filter in Verilog. 

## Instructions to run
**Step 1:** Getting the Filter coefficients from MATLAB 
To obtain the filter coefficients, MATLABâ€™s FDA Tool is used. It can be accessed using the following command:

>> filterDesigner

This opens a graphical interface (as shown below) where the filter parameters can be configured and export the coefficients
